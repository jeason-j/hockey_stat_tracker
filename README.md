# License
I prefer to license things under the MIT license however due to the infectious
nature of the GPL license which the GxEPD library in this project uses the
entire distributed work must be released under GPL. IoTHockey.ino still maintains
an MIT license within it so that file alone can be taken under the MIT license
as I understand it. I'm not a lawyer though, I'm just a guy who likes to write software
and share it with people.
